summary: "Scientists have long theorized that social behavior helps animals navigate during long, difficult migrations. We studied Pacific salmon behavior at dams, where they must locate and climb challenging "fish ladders" before making it home to breed. The prevailing wisdom is that overcrowding is the dominant social effect at fish ladders. However, we found strong evidence that Chinook salmon (but surprisingly not the more social sockeye) actually benefit from sociality during this process."
