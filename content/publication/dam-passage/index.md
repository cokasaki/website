abstract: The mass migration of animals is one of the great wonders of the natural world. Although there are multiple benefits for individuals migrating in groups, an increasingly recognized benefit is collective navigation, whereby social interactions improve animals' ability to find their way. Despite substantial evidence from theory and lab-based experiments, empirical evidence of collective navigation in nature remains sparse. Here we used a unique large-scale radiotelemetry dataset to analyze the movements of adult Pacific salmon (*Oncorhynchus sp.*) in the Columbia River Basin, USA. These salmon face substantial migratory challenges approaching, entering, and transiting fishways at multiple large-scale hydroelectric mainstem dams. We assess the potential role of collective navigation in overcoming these challenges and show that Chinook salmon (*O. tshawytscha*), but not sockeye salmon (*O. nerka*) locate fishways faster and pass in fewer attempts at higher densities, consistent with collective navigation. The magnitude of the density effects were comparable with major established drivers such as water temperature, and model simulations predicted that major fluctuations in population density can have substantial impacts on key quantities including mean passage time and fraction of fish with very long passage times. The magnitude of these effects indicate the importance of incorporating conspecific density and social dynamics into models of the migration process. Density effects on both ability to locate fishways and number of passage attempts have the potential to enrich our understanding of migratory energetics and success of migrating anadromous salmonids. More broadly, our work reveals a potential role of collective navigation, in at least one species, to mitigate the effects of anthropogenic barriers to animals on the move.

summary: "Scientists have long theorized that social behavior helps animals navigate during long, difficult migrations. We studied Pacific salmon behavior at dams, where they must locate and climb challenging 'fish ladders' before making it home to breed. The prevailing wisdom is that overcrowding is the dominant social effect at fish ladders. However, we found strong evidence that Chinook salmon (but surprisingly not the more social sockeye) actually benefit from sociality during this process."
