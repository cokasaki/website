abstract: Antibiotic resistance is a problem of significant and growing international concern, in part due to the rapid evolution of new resistances. One potentially important factor in the emergence of resistance is concentrated antibiotic use in environments such as hospitals. Such high ese creates a strong selective pressure for pathogens to evolve resistance. We analyze some strategies hospitals can use to slow the evolution of resistance, and estimate the length of the delay between evolution and outbreak of resistance.
