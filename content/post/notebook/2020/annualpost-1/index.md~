I am just starting this lab notebook now in March 2020, so almost a third of the year is behind me already. That said, one of my big goals for the year, submitting my [dam passage](content/project/dam-passage-time) paper to Proc B, I have already accomplished! Hooray! Hopefully I can continue the momentum now that COVID-19 has well and truly set in.

## Goals ##

I have a tendency to be overly ambitious with my goal timelines. I think I'm okay with that for now, but I'm trying to temper my expectations a little bit. I'm hopeful that with my dam passage project behind me I can focus my time and make more steady progress on my other projects.
- Complete my bypass to the PhD track by April 1
   - This is a pretty near-term goal but has been a long time coming
   - At this point most of what I need is just to do a bunch of lit reviewing and write up a beefier dissertation proposal than I had the first time round
- Submit my source inference paper by August 1 2020
   - Hopefully the timeline on this is not too ambitious. I have a lot of the theory and code done already, but case studies, editting, and background reading take forever.
   - Sub goal: Write up animal movement case study by April 10
   - Sub goal: Set up model and begin data analysis for pollen case study by April 17
   - Sub goal: Write up pollen case study by May 1
   - Sub goal: Complete third case study by June 5
   - Sub goal: Complete all background reading by June 5
   - Sub goal: Complete final editing by July 3
   - This leaves one month of wiggle room for things to take longer than I hope
- Prepare to TA by September 15
   - This fall will be my first time TAing in any capacity since I was an undergrad. I will have more responsibility now than I did then and I want to make sure I am prepared. To do this I plan on doing background reading on teaching and TAing ahead of time. I know the best experience comes from doing but this is all I can do for now.
   - Sub goal: Browse UW TAing [resources](https://www.washington.edu/teaching/topics/just-for-tas)
   - Sub goal: Browse CMU CollectedWisdom TAing [resource](https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/resources/PublicationsArchives/CollectedWisdom/collectwisdom-teachingstrategies.pdf)
   - Sub goal: Read some of the evidence-based [Visible Learning](https://visible-learning.org/) resources
   - I haven't assigned sub-goal deadlines because these are resources I intend to digest slowly over the period. Instead my goal is to do a little of this every week.
- Submit my spatial survey design paper by Jan 1
   - I feel pretty good about getting the other goals done, if not on time, at least this year. This one is the stretch-iest of all of them. But I certainly won't do it if I give up on it now!
   - Sub goal: Find good spatial dataset by May 1
   - Sub goal: Complete background reading by July 3
   - Sub goal: Complete simulated case study by September 18
   - Sub goal: Complete final edits by December 1
