## Reality ##

Did all these things although I did not finish writing up the animal movement case study -- there's a lot more background to include. Read and took notes on both VL Ch 5 and 6. Turns out the pollen dataset that I thought was from AAAAI/NAB was actually not. It is more paleoecological than really pollen counts that we're looking for. Only real pollen counts I've been able to find so far are AAAAI and EAN (Europe) both of which are closely guarded and cannot be made public. I'd really like to use a public dataset so I'm not sure what to do about this...however I did find a wind speed dataset that seems to be pretty decent although right now it only seems to be marine measurements so I'm trying to see if there's a land-based sister dataset.
