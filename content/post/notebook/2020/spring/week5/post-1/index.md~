## Goals ##
- Need to debug and write up the animal movement case study, as I have fallen behind on my goal for that
- Need to import pollen data and set up a preliminary model for it
- Keep working a little bit on the SNN modeling math to get it into shape
- Finish up notes on VL Ch 3 and 4
- Read and take notes on VL Ch 5 and 6
- Find large spatial dataset for optimal sampling design
- Need to write up NSF GRF progress report

## Reality ##
Did debug and partially write up the animal movement case study but there is still more writing/background to do there. Found a problem with the pollen data so that also will take longer than expected. Worked a little bit on the SSN modeling and found a matrix formulation for it (another DT lyapunov equation) although in the end it'll probably all be finite difference anyways. Took notes on VL Ch 3-6, and decided with S&aacute;ndor that we will just do a purely synthetic dataset to start for the sampling design. Wrote up NSF progress report, although still waiting on Andrew to sign off.
