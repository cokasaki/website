## Goals ##

Morning: 9-12:30
- Look at QSCI stuff

Afternoon: 1:30-3:30
- Computer lab

Afternoon: 3:30-5
- Work on Dirichlet BC code

## Reality ##

Made some good progress on remembering how all the [model diagnostics](/courses/qsci-483/linear-algebra/math-diagnostics) work. Taking this as an opportunity to go beyond what the course really calls for and cement my understanding of these things because they're important to know.

Lab went well.

Dirichlet BC stuff is chugging along. I definitely did something wrong last time, I think, because I'm running into new challenges. Good that I'm reimplementing it. I think I have figured out how to deal with these challenges (i.e. get sparse posterior $Q_u$ and then sample from $f$ as a degenerate MVN conditional on $u$.
