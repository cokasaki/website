## Goals ##

First real week of the quarter and I am surprise TAing! I also found some frustrating uncommitted code from my Colorado trip which I need to reimplement, but rewriting code is often a way to make it better anyways...
- Make all suggested changes to bypass proposal by Wednesday and send to committee
- Read chapters 1 and 2 of Visible Learning by Wednesday/Friday
- Do the QSCI hw ahead of time to make sure I've got it down by Tuesday
- Rewrite Dirichlet BC code by Friday
