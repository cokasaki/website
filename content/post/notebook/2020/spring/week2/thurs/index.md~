## Goals ##

Morning: 9-12
- Work on Dirichlet BC code

Afternoon: 1-1:30
- Take notes from Visible Learning Chapter 2

Afternoon: 1:30-3:30
- Attend class and continue looking at QSCI HW 1

Afternoon: 3:30-5
- Work on Dirichlet BC code

## Reality ##

Wrote up some [resources](/courses/gaussian-processes) so that I can stop rederiving/looking up common GP/MVN properties that I need to use. Also included on there the math for Dirichlet BCs. Now that the derivation is there I can more effectively write the code for the implementation, rather than writing stuff down on paper every time I try to do this.

Forgot to account in my scheduling today for time to edit and submit my dissertation proposal. Did that.

Wrote up notes for VL Ch 2, and continued to expand on my own [notes](/courses/qsci-483) for QSCI, reminding myself how all the [model diagnostics](/courses/qsci-483/linear-regression/diagnostics) work.
