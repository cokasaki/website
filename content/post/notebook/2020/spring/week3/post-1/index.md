## Goals ##

Still need to finish up my Dirichlet BC code from last week but I got a lot off my plate! I am done with the bypass and the dam passage paper and can get back to research more-or-less full time (less my new TAing position). My next few goals for spring quarter are all focused on my source project, but I would like to make some more progress on the optimal design front to keep some forward momentum on that front.

I would like to spend this week doing a mix of: finishing up the Dirichlet code and hopefully the animal movement case study, TAing, and responding to feedback from my bypass proposal. So my goals are
- Finish up Dirichlet BC code by Tuesday
- Read Visible Learning Chapters 3 and 4 by Wednesday/Friday
- Debug animal movement code and get it run at least once by Thursday
- Respond to S&aacute;ndor's email by Tuesday
- Read two of Mevin's suggested papers by Wednesday, the rest by Friday

## Reality ##
- Finished up the Dirichlet BC code
- Read but have not yet taken notes on VL Chs 3 and 4
- Ran the animal movement code many times, but still debugging
- Still need to get back to Mevin and S&aacute;ndor with updates.
