## Goals ##

First real week of the quarter and I am surprise TAing! I also found some frustrating uncommitted code from my Colorado trip which I need to reimplement, but rewriting code is often a way to make it better anyways...
- Make all suggested changes to bypass proposal by Wednesday and send to committee
- Read chapters 1 and 2 of Visible Learning by Wednesday/Friday
- Do the QSCI hw ahead of time to make sure I've got it down by Tuesday
- Rewrite Dirichlet BC code by Friday

## Reality ##

Spent a lot of time on TAing this week, getting back up to speed on the basics of linear regression and model diagnostics. Mostly for myself, I made up a bunch of notes on the [math](/courses/qsci-483) behind these topics, to cement my own understanding, although the students certainly won't need to know much of that. I made it through the first two chapters of Visible Learning, although I still feel like I need to discuss it with someone to really digest it properly.

I didn't finish off the Dirichlet code but I'm close: I got the theory worked out again, and I think I actually had it wrong the first time. I also got my bypass submitted and approved which is awesome and a big relief!
