## Goals ##

Morning: 9-12:30
- Work on Dirichlet BC stuff

Afternoon: 1:30-3:30
- Work on QSCI483 stuff

Afternoon: 3:30-5
- Work on Dirichlet BC stuff

## Reality ##

Made some really good progress on Dirichlet BC stuff, but did not manage to get the code to a working point. I feel like I have a good handle on QSCI for this week, and I made some good progress on stream network analysis.
