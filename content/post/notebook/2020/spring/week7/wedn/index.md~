## Goals ##
Find a dataset on Neotoma and debug the optimization case study. 

## Reality ##
Spent a lot of time on both tasks. Neotoma is remarkably difficult to use. I'm trying to learn a tiny bit of SQL to access it because I don't think there is a better dataset out there for this project, but it has been frustrating. The optimization still is not solving. I think it is either an issue with the bounds or an issue with the size of the problem.
