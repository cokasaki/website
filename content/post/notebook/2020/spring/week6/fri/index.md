## Reality ##
Lots of scattered goals today so not all of them actually happened. I did look into the paleopollen stuff but there's a lot there so still need to sift through what may be most applicable. I took some notes on Ch 7 but not Ch 8, and I did read some fun papers. Spent much more than 1 hour debugging the sampling design code but I did finally get it working!
