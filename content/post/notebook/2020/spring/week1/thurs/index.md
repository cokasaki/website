## Goals ##

Morning: 9-12
- Fix Anaconda errors and start animal movement MCMC running overnight

Afternoon: 1-3
- Start reading UW TA resources

Afternoon: 3-5
- Think more about second-order inclusion probabilities

## Reality ##

Fixed Anaconda error, then discovered issue where some code was not pushed to GitHub. Unable to find the original code (mostly my implementation of Dirichlet BCs), but re-writing it should be a useful (if annyoing) exercise.

Started reading UW resources and made several [posts](/post/teaching). Not all of it is relevant just yet, but I'd like to get through all of it and start thinking about everything together.

Found [this paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23357227) about random sampling with given second-order inclusion probabilities. It gives results about which inclusion probability matrices (IPMs) are valid (the answer is complicated) and constructed a maximum-entropy distribution for fixed-size sampling with fixed IPM.

Thoughts on IPMs:
- Want to incorporate logistics somehow
- Can we estimate IPMs after filtering for feasible designs?
- Can we calculate IPMs after filtering for feasible designs?
- Can we calculate probability of infeasibility for CP(2) designs?
- How do CP(2) designs work in space-time?
- I feel like there's something in here somewhere but it's buried deep
