## Goals ##

Afternoon: 3-5

## Reality ##

Schedule:
The UW resource page has 20 sections. The CMU page has 16 sections, and the Visual Learning book has 31 chapters. I plan on reading roughly 1 section, 1 section, and 2 chapters each week, starting next week.

Proposal:
Completed and sent to Andrew for feedback.

Animal Movement:
Looked over the code, tried to re-run it. Got an Anaconda version conflict that I don't remember. Will plan on dealing with that tomorrow.
