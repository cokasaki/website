## Goals ##

Morning: 9-12
- Set up virtual lab notebook and COVID-19 accountability structure

Afternoon: 1-3
- Add references for optimal design chapter

Afternoon: 3-5
- Refamiliarize myself with animal movement case study


## Reality ##

Morning: 9-12
- Set up virtual lab notebook and COVID-19 accountability structure

Afternoon: 1-4
- Add references for optimal design chapter
   - including major reference to Lee 1998, which actually does do logistically constrained optimal design but with a different objective function
   - propose to compare performance of my method with his, as well as to speed up his method with sparse matrices

Afternoon: 4-5
- Work on new idea for logistically-constrained design
   - logistically-constrained random sampling?
   - a number of possibilities for how to achieve it
   - all rely upon being able to calculate or estimate $\pi_i$ and $\pi_{ij}$ the first- and second-order inclusion probabilities
   - if we want to estimate them, can we define a Gaussian-like spatial process over second-order inclusion probabilities
   - how can we do that? what is the domain of valid second-order inclusion probability matrices?
