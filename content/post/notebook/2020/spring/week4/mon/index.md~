## Goals ##

Morning: 9-11
- Prep for the week and finish up my preliminary analysis for the spatial stream network model

Afternoon: 11-1:30
- Work on Dirichlet BC code
- Try to run it at least once

Afternoon: 1:30-3:30
- TAing

Afternoon: 3:30-5
- Look at bypass responses

## Reality ##

Morning stuff went well but I fell into administrative tasks and did not get the code done. I did email my committee, email with Erica about my TAing position, and email with the stats department about the concurrent master's program. I took a brief look at Mevin's response in the afternoon.
