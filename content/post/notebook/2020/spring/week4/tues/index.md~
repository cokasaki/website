## Reality ##

Got side tracked with adminstrative stuff again. Evidently I have to formally apply to the concurrent MS program in the stats department so that will take up much of my week. I did get the Dirichlet code up and running although there are probably a few lingering bugs. MCMC run is going now. Did not get to VL or emailing S&aacute;ndor, although I actually looked at his email and there is not too much to respond to directly. I do owe him an update soon though.
