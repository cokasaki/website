title: 'Lab Notebook Structure'
---

In this post I will outline the structure of my virtual lab notebook, for use during this time of woe. This is necessitated by the current COVID-19 work-from-home crisis, but will be helpful in general as a tool for accountability and productivity.

## Post Frequency ##

I will post to the lab notebook at the beginning and end of each year, quarter, and week. I will also post to the lab notebook once per day.

## Post Content ##

In each multi-day post I will outline my goals for the current time period, along with a self-imposed due date, and (particularly for yearly and quarterly posts) a rough outline of intermediate steps. Then at the end of the period I will summarize my progress toward those goals as well as any major progress in addition to those goals that I undertook in that time.

In each daily post I will outline what my goals were for the day, along with what I actually spent my time on. I will post mathematical and scientific outputs such as documents and plots that I produced that day, and reflect on my productivity and time management.
