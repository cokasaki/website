Notes from UWs TA [page](https://www.washington.edu/teaching/topics/assessing-and-improving-teaching/assessing-student-lerning-grading).

Four recommendations from UW:
- Create clear grading criteria
- Communicate these criteria to students
- Give constructive feedback
- Employ time management strategies when grading large amounts of work

Expect students to:
- focus their time and effort on the things with the highest grading weights
- be sensitive about their grades, and ask about grading-related topics frequently
-

Concrete Actions:
- create, communicate, and remind students about clear grading criteria
- create clear expectations about edge cases like late papers, exam timing, grade changes, and typos on assignments
- keep thorough records of evaluations, and keep for a while after the quarter is over
- promptly document interactions with unhappy students

## Grading ##

[Grading](https://www.washington.edu/teaching/topics/preparing-to-teach/grading-2) is really hard. First thing to make clear is that I am using mastery-based (i.e. individual skills) rather than norm-referenced (i.e. relative to each other) grading.
- Be consistent
- Make sure students know what to expect
   - What is being measured, how is it being measured, what does this have to do with the course at large?
   - Do students need to recall information, recognize patterns, draw inferences, make connections, construct an argument, or what?
- Mastery-based grading requires very clear measurable goals and objectives
   - Likely want to make some re-adjustment of pre-set expectations based on actual performance. Perhaps the test really was too hard?

## Cheating ##

How to stop it:
- Explain clearly what is and is not allowed
- Encourage students to seek help:
   - Often students cheat because they are doing poorly
   - Encourage them to schedule a meeting and/or come to office hours
- Give alternating versions of exams (different orders if not different questions)
- Regularly walk around the room and observe students
- After the exam mark answer sheets in such a way that alterations cannot be made (possibly scan a copy of each exam if possible)
- Give an alternate exam version for make-ups
- Homework assignments are difficult to monitor
   - UW recommends lowering the amount of the grade HW is worth...I don't know about that
   - Replace homework with in-class quizzes?
- Final projects
   - Think about whether students may have done similar projects in other classes


What to do when it happens:
- There is a specific [reporting tool](https://www.washington.edu/cssc/facultystaff/report-academic-misconduct) but for TAs it probably goes through the instructor first
