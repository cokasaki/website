Notes from "[Teaching More by Grading Less](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arrticles/PMC4041495)".

Grading is a ubiquitious but surprisingly recent phenomenon. The current A-D+F system only gained popularity in the 1940s. Grades are intended as feedback on performance, motivators of student effort, tools for comparing students, and objective evaluations of student knowledge. However, these goals are rarely achieved.

On the contrary, more qualitative feedback describing how work could be improved is more effective, and grades often distract from this feedback. Grades dampen intrinsic motivation, enhance fear of failure, reduce interest, decrease enjoyment, increase anxiety, stimulate aviodance, heighten competitiveness, and even hamper performance. Grading systems that reward effort seem to have better reception.

Grades are further unhelpful as a tool for comparing students. Curve-grading might be thought to be the fairest approach but in reality this mostly stimulates competition, while divorcing grades from actual mastery.

Finally, grades are inconsistent and subjective measures of mastery. They vary wildly between different graders, and even between the same grader over time.

So what does work? The authors propose (a) balancing accuracy-based with effort-based grading (b) providing meaningful feedback through self- and peer-evaluation (c) avoiding curving (d) blind grading when possible and (e) providing rubrics for any graded assessments that are necessary.
