title: 'Classroom Practices'

I want to:
- Learn everyone's name by week 1
-

First day:
- Introduce myself:
   - Name/pronouns, background, formality, how/when to reach me
- Notecards:
   - Preferred name/pronunciation/pronouns
   - Accommodation requests
- Expectations:
   - grading/deadline criteria
   - classroom policies
   - my commitments as a teacher
   - how I intend to teach/assess
   - add codes/course conflicts
   - course schedule
- Quick (ungraded) quiz to gauge background? Self-reported pre-assessment of background knowledge? Resources for filling in gaps? ``Common Sense Inventory:'' determine whether 15 statements related to course content are true or false?
- Homework 0: voluntary/mandatory office hour?
- If there is time left to teach, model what the rest of the course will be like. Think about whether registration has stabilized and whether to teach foundational material, or just interesting stuff
