I want to:
- Learn everyone's name by week 1
-

First day:
- Introduce myself:
   - Name/pronouns, background, formality, how/when to reach me
- Notecards:
   - Preferred name/pronunciation/pronouns
   - Accommodation requests
- Expectations:
   - grading/deadline criteria
   - classroom policies
   - my commitments as a teacher
   - how I intend to teach/assess
   - add codes/course conflicts
   - course schedule
- Quick (ungraded) quiz to gauge background? Self-reported pre-assessment of background knowledge? Resources for filling in gaps? ``Common Sense Inventory:'' determine whether 15 statements related to course content are true or false?
- Homework 0: voluntary/mandatory office hour?
- If there is time left to teach, model what the rest of the course will be like. Think about whether registration has stabilized and whether to teach foundational material, or just interesting stuff

General Practices
- Tie things into what I'm excited about. Students can tell if you're into it
- Give real world examples/applications, particularly in my own work
- Keep up a high degree of connectivity, explain how things relate to other things
- [Active learning](https://www.washington.edu/teaching/topics/engaging-students-in-learning/promoting-student-engagement-through-active-learning) is good. Give students a chance to practice that thing they just learned

## Office Hours ##

- Most important thing is getting people to come in the first place
- Give feedback on what's been done so far and offer direction and general guidance
- Ask them to explain their work and thought process so far
   - If that leaves a blank, ask them to solve an easier problem
- Try to get them to ask specific questions:
   - Is X true?
   - Does this specific logic follow?
- Ask leading questions
- Try to understand what their thought process is, they are likely coming from a different background than me and will think about things in a different way
- Work through the homework and exams ahead of time
   - Try to anticipate sticking points and wrong turns
- Know and communicate the instructors expectations and emphasize this material
