Notes from UWs TA [page](https://www.washington.edu/teaching/topics/assessing-and-improving-teaching/assessing-student-lerning-grading).

Four recommendations from UW:
- Create clear grading criteria
- Communicate these criteria to students
- Give constructive feedback
- Employ time management strategies when grading large amounts of work

Expect students to:
- focus their time and effort on the things with the highest grading weights
- be sensitive about their grades, and ask about grading-related topics frequently
-

Concrete Actions:
- create, communicate, and remind students about clear grading criteria
- create clear expectations about edge cases like late papers, exam timing, grade changes, and typos on assignments
- keep thorough records of evaluations, and keep for a while after the quarter is over
- promptly document interactions with unhappy students
