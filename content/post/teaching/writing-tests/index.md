Notes from UWs TA [page](https://www.washington.edu/teaching/topics/preparing-to-teach/constructing-tests).

Consider:
- Why am I testing:
   - to monitor progress and adjust the pace of the course?
   - to motivate students
   - to provide data for a grade?
   - to challenge students to apply concepts?
   - Use this information to design the exam
- Is my test consistent with my teaching:
   - [Backwards design](post/teaching/course-design) will help with this
   - If the test emphasizes analysis and synthesis, make sure class time does as well
- Do the students know what to expect?
   - Does the test match my stated course goals
   - Have I reviewed the material on the test/explained what will be tested?
- Does my exam test a range of learning?
   - Do students who have not mastered everything have room to demonstrate growth?

Multiple choice exams:
- Easy to grade
- Good for testing recall and facts, difficult to test analysis
- Make sure question is clear without reading the answers
   - Can a prepared student or colleague answer the question as a free response?
- Avoid making the right answer stand out for the wrong reasons (i.e. grammer, length)
- Assess the exam questions afterwards:
   - Which questions were most difficult?
   - Were there questions which most students with high-grades missed?

Regardless of exam format, assessing it after the fact is important:
- Did I test what I thought I was testing?
- Did I test what I tught?
- Did I test what I emphasized?
- Did I test what I really wanted the students to learn?
- If answers to these questions come back no, possibly go back to the Backwards Design and rethink course/assessment structure.
