title: 'Teaching for automaticity in basic academic skill'
---

After large amounts of time spent practicing and recalling information, that information becames automatic. It is quickly and subconsciously accessible and does not impose upon expensive higher-level thought processes. When information is not automatic, these thought processes require are extremely tiring.

Reading is a natural example: when we read our eyes _saccade_ or quickly refixate about every quarter-second. The eye focuses on the next word in sequence and we process each word individually for meaning at that pace. Missing the meaning of even a single word can threaten the understanding of the whole sentence, and so the mind automatizes this process after months or years of practice. Moreover, in order to synthesize and comprehend longer sentences and arguments, words must be processes fast enough for the whole argument to be held in working memory. Slow reading due to lack of automaticity threatens this process.

The theory that certain students struggle with reading comprehension because they are slow to process individual words is known as the _simple theory of reading_. Even though a child may understand each word individually, they cannot comprehend the whole sentence unless they can process words fast enough to intake the whole sentence more or less at once. This automatic processing is not possible without many many hours of intensive self-directed practice.

Number facts follow a similar pattern. Although mathematics instruction often focuses on "surface learning" vs "deep understanding," there is almost no meaningful distinction between these, particularly in early education. The importance of automaticity and reducing cogniftive load is such that basic drilling of sums and products is necessary to develop future math skills. Furthermore speed of access of these number facts (among others) is associated with higher confidence and positive feelings.

Ultimately these important automatic skills can only be developed through large amounts of invested time, over the course of years. No one teacher can be responsible for these processes, but all must contribute for successful education to occur.
