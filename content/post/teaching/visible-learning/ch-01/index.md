title: "Why Don\'t Students Like School?"
---

- There is no serious evidence that students, on average, actively *dislike* school. Rather they are neutral, or mildly positive towards school.
- A frequent challenge faced by teachers is the apathy of students on an individual level, after working so hard to provide an engaging learning experience.
- VL puts forward the following hypothesis, following researcher Daniel Willingham:
  - The human brain is not primarily designed for "thinking": it is designed for sociality, for language learning, for spatial reasoning, etc. Higher level reasoning is not the primary purpose and is, on average, very difficult.
  - This means that thinking uses up limited resources very quickly
  - Asking someone to invest this level of effort/resources is a hard task. The outcome of a "thinking" task could be positive (better understanding) or negative (no progress). Humans are risk-averse and are unlikely to invest effort if they cannot see a likely short-term pay-off.
  - This means the best way to get effort out of students is to show them short-term goals that seem achievable: "we are motivated by knowledge gaps, but put off by knowledge chasms." We cannot be curious about everything, and are instead curious about the things we feel we can understand with little additional effort

- The ease with which people can access information has a large effect on how they use that information, and how they feel about that information
- We rely much more heavily on memory than thinking: it is generally easier to remember a previous result than to derive it from scratch
