title: 'The role of feedback'
---

Teachers have long lists of reasons why feedback is important. Students overwhelmingly look to feedback for only one thing: how to improve their work to succeed next time. Students tend to focus on the future over the past, and often interpret even constructive feedback on past work as personal attacks and can react defensively.

The impact of negative events is stronger than the impact of positive events, but despite this teachers consistently give more negative feedback than positive.
