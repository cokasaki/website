title: 'Your personality as a teacher'
---

Nearly a century of research has shown that there is _NOT_ a "best" personality for a teacher to have. Students value being treated with fairness, dignity, and respect much more than they value a particular personality type.

It has been found that children lose respect for adults who violate basic social rules, exhibit cruelty, or otherwise break social conventions. Studies show that very young children possess a strong sense of what is right and wrong and have a deep sense of fairness. They may not behave in this manner, since social judgment and risk assessment develop much later. Almost universally though, basic misdeeds such as being caught lying incur significant degradation of trust and positive relationships.

Studies show that students evaluate teachers after exposure for as little as 10 seconds. This is an example of the _blink effect_.
