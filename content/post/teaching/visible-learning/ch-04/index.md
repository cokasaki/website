title: 'Your personality as a teacher'
---

Nearly a century of research has shown that there is _NOT_ a "best" personality for a teacher to have. Students value being treated with fairness, dignity, and respect much more than they value a particular personality type.

It has been found that children lose respect for adults who violate basic social rules, exhibit cruelty, or otherwise break social conventions. Studies show that very young children possess a strong sense of what is right and wrong and have a deep sense of fairness. They may not behave in this manner, since social judgment and risk assessment develop much later. Almost universally though, basic misdeeds such as being caught lying incur significant degradation of trust and positive relationships.

Studies show that students evaluate teachers after exposure for as little as 10 seconds. This is an example of the _blink effect_. Moreover, these blink assessments are at least somewhat accurate, being correlated with ratings from actual students (although possible this could be an example of the blink effect itself being cemented in place in those genuine students). Deliberate use of warm and inviting body language, direct eye contact, and friendly intonation increased scores on academic tests for 7-year old students.

It is very difficult to detect when children tell lies. Children develop skillful deceit at a very young age and from that point accuracy for telling lies is about 60% (barely above random chance). Rather, we are very good at detecting emotions, but emotions are poor indicators of deceit since truth-tellers often show signs of anxiety when placed under suspicion. Meanwhile liars may prepare for being grilled. Takeaway: do not expect to be able to tell if a student is lying from social cues.

Seeking help in the classroom is a good thing, and should not be conflated with dependency (relying on a single source excessively and consistently). Help-seeking is associated with "mastery goal orientation" where students are motivated by factors involving understanding and acquiring knowledge. This contrasts with "ego orientation" or "performance orientation" where the goal is to look good or outperform one's immediate peers. Both orientatios coexist, but mastery orientation is associated with higher performance and deeper understanding.

Students are more likely to seek help if they trust their teacher, and if their teacher encourages help-seeking behavour. As students age they begin to associate question-asking with low ability. However, with supportive teachers, students associate question asking more positively.
