title: 'Time as a global indicator of classroom learning'
---

Your pedagogical philosophy has no bearing on student outcomes unless you spend time on the issues you claim to emphasize.

Studies used four different measures of time (see VL pg. 37) each a subset of the last
- Allocated time
  - time as programmed proactively, on documents and curriculum plans
  - problems: interruptions, visitors, announcements, transitions
  - improved by: school mandated policy
- Instructional time
  - actual time genuinely available for instruction
  - problems: poor classroom management, allowing time to be hijacked by low-priority issues
  - improved by: managerial skill and time prioritization
- Engaged time
  - time student actually pays attention
  - problems: students not knowing what to focus on, distractions, boredom, fatigue
  - improved by: clear instructions and meaningful tasks, encouragement, feedback
- Academic learning time
  - time when student is learning and responding successfully
  - problems: student may be unsuccessful despite effort, gaps in prior knowledge, tasks too challenging
  - improved by: individualized guidance, encouragement

Amount of time dedicated to a particular task varies wildly between different teachers. However the most critical measure of time is academic learning time. Higher tiers can be used to help maximize academic learning time but this is the level that is most consistently correlated with student success. However, just spending time with a topic does not necessarily imply improvement. Rather deliberate practice with a focus on improvement is necessary, with critical components including guidance, instruction, goal setting, and feedback.

Time is particular important for forming deep understanding and connections between topics. Comparing curriculums streamlined to cover the same material in shorter or longer periods of time, there was no difference in test scores on surface-level multiple choice questions. However, free response questions meant to test deep understanding and connections between topics showed wild variation with much higher scores for the students that took the longer courses.
