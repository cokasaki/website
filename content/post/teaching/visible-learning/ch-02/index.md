title: 'Is Knowledge an Obstacle to Teaching?'
---

- Experts in a subject matter area seem to have worse intuition for teaching that subject matter, compared to novices
  - In theory this is because they have learned to think about it in a structured and organized way that is not the most effective way to _learn_ that material
  - Experts consistently underestimated how difficult a task is. Novices, having just learned it, know how difficult it is to learn and teach a more basic level
  - Although students rated novices higher and performed better on a post-teaching assessment, the expert-taught students performed better on transferring their learning to a related task
- Students appreciate being taught by knowledgeable, motivated, passionate individuals
  - Students will rate their best teachers highly on competency, credibility, and fariness
  - More closely related to student motivation than actual learning. However children learn less from adults they view as ignorant
- Knowledge about subject matter may make it harder to teach in a group setting, but on an individual level enables you to provide helpful feedback, and contextualize a student's ideas and progress against your own knowledge base.
