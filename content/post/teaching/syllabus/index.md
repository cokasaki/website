[Backward Design](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/understanding-by-design/#resources):
- Let students know in reverse
   - What are your learning goals?
   - How will you assess those goals
   - How will you achieve those goals through teaching?

[Assessments]()
- Note explicitly that the course is NOT graded on a curve
- Grading is detrimental to learning and to teaching
   - Balancing grading on effort vs accuracy
      - Allow grades to be re-earned in office hours
   - If ability to generalize is valued a project is a must
   - Daily self-graded quizzes may be a good thing
      - Self-grading practices meta-thinking, how did I go wrong?
      - Reduces grading burden on me
   - Homework extensions are onerous but compassionate
      - Grading on the median with no extensions is one option
      - Dropping a lot of assignments is another
         - Students with extreme difficulties may have extra assignments dropped from grade rather than extensions
   
   
## What Are My Learning Goals ##

[Bloom's Taxonomy](https://teaching.uncc.edu/sites/teaching.uncc.edu/files/media/files/file/GoalsAndObjectives/Bloom.pdf):
- A way of classifying increasingly ambitious learning objectives
- Three taxonomies for:
   - Knowledge-based goals
   - Skills-based foals
   - Affective goals (related to values, attitudes, interests)

## How Will I Assess Those Goals

Both during the course and at the end of the course. Designing [assessments](/post/teaching/assessment) is a whole separate can of worms.

## How Will I Achieve Those Goals ##

Before I get into the nitty-gritty of lesson planning, etc, now is also a good time to write a [syllabus](https://www.washington.edu/teaching/topics/preparing-to-teach/designing-your-course-and-syllabus). Once I've done that I think I personally will benefit from calendaring. This will help me remember little things like: two weeks from today is the exam, I need to write it so I can tell students about format, etc.
