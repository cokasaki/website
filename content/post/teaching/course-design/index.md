Notes from UWs TA [page](https://washington.edu/teaching/topics/preparing-to-teach/designing-your-course-and-syllabus).

[Backward Design](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/understanding-by-design/#resources):
- Design a course in reverse by considering
   - What are your learning goals?
   - How will you assess those goals?
   - How will you achieve those goals through teaching?
- In this way everything done in the course is intentional and working towards an established goal


## Who Are My Students ##

Before I even get to learning goals, also consider: who are my students? Why are they taking my course? What can I expect that they already know? What range of backgrounds might the have? What do I expect them to struggle with?

## What Are My Learning Goals ##

[Blooms Taxonomy](https://teaching.uncc.edu/sites/teaching.uncc.edu/files/media/files/file/GoalsAndObjectives/Bloom.pdf):
- A way of classifying increasingly ambitious learning objectives
- Three taxonomies for:
   - Knowledge-based goals
   - Skills-based foals
   - Affective goals (related to values, attitudes, interests)

## How Will I Assess Those Goals

Both during the course and at the end of the course. Designing [assessments](/post/teaching/assessment) is a whole separate can of worms.

## How Will I Achieve Those Goals ##

Before I get into the nitty-gritty of lesson planning, etc, now is also a good time to write a [syllabus](https://www.washington.edu/teaching/topics/preparing-to-teach/designing-your-course-and-syllabus). Once I've done that I think I personally will benefit from calendaring. This will help me remember little things like: two weeks from today is the exam, I need to write it so I can tell students about format, etc.
