In this course, instructor Timothy Jones will cover regression techniques from linear and nonlinear regression, time series and spatial analysis, and generalized linear modeling, with an emphasis on application, model diagnostics, and model selection. I will post on this site my own supplementary notes that I develop over the course of TAing, as I review this material. It is primarily meant as a tool to structure my own understanding, but it is my hope that it will be useful to students as well.
