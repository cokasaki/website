summary: "We investigated the possibility for collective behavior of salmon to facilitate navigation of man-made dams along the Columbia river. We found that Chinook salmon may benefit from sociality, while the paradoxically more social sockeye salmon does not, and hypothesize as to why this may be."

In this project I use a bootstrap method to test a radio-telemetry dataset of Chinook and sockeye salmon for evidence of collective navigation while using fish ladders to pass dams.
