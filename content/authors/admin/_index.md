I am a third-year PhD student in Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management at the University of Washington. I am advised by Andrew Berdahl in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences. I am collaborating with S&aacute;ndor Toth from the School of Environmental and Forestry Sciences on a project looking at optimal spatial sampling design under logistical constraints. I am also collaborating with Mevin Hooten from Colorado State University on a project looking at physics-based spatiotemporal statistics. My general research interests include bridging the gaps between mechanistic modeling, spatial statistics, and constrained optimization. I am particularly interested in taking mathematically complex methods and ideas and making them more accessible and useful to ecologists.
